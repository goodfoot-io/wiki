<golden-rule>
After making any changes to code or configuration files, lint, type check, and run all tests. (Not required for markdown, JSON, or CSS changes.)

異常を検知した時点で、誰もが即時に可視化・共有し、作業を一旦停止して真因を特定し、再発防止策（恒久対策）を講じてから再開する。

This applies to all warnings and failures encountered during validation, not only warnings or failures caused by your changes. Do not dismiss failures as "pre-existing" or "unrelated."

**A test that does not run because of an infrastructure error is a blocking condition.** Do not proceed with implementation.
</golden-rule>

<greenfield>
This is a greenfield implementation. Do not create migrations, backwards compatibility, or fallbacks.

<right-way-over-easy-way>
Always choose the "right way" over the "easy way".

<fail-closed>
Prefer 'fail closed' workflows over 'fail open' workflows.

<commit-message>
Do not include a "Co-Authored-By: Claude ..." message in commits.

<workspace-information>
Our workspace uses Yarn 4.x as a package manager. Do not use other package managers such as 'npm'.

This is a Yarn 4.x monorepo with packages in ./packages/ containing a Rust CLI (packages/cli) and a VSCode extension (packages/extension).

Use local rather than origin branches.

<jsdoczoom>

**Shows increasing levels of documentation in TypeScript files based on JSDoc annotations.**

```bash
# Use instead of `find . -name "*.ts" | xargs grep -ril "CacheKey|buildIndex|TreeNode"`
jsdoczoom ./src/** --search "CacheKey|buildIndex|TreeNode"
```

Each output header - "# [FILE PATH]@[DEPTH]" - is the next drill-down selector.

Run `jsdoczoom [FILE PATH]@[DEPTH]` to get deeper information on the file.

Then `jsdoczoom [FILE PATH]@[DEPTH + 1]` to get deeper still.

```bash
# The --search value is a regex passed as a plain string — never escape | or other regex metacharacters
jsdoczoom --search "foo|bar"      # GOOD: matches either foo or bar
jsdoczoom --search "foo\|bar"     # BAD: treats \| as a literal character, not alternation
```

Use the `jsdoczoom:jsdoczoom` subagent instead of the `Explore` subagent to answer code questions in this repository.

<wiki>

This repository stores documentation in a central `./wiki/**/*.md` wiki and in individual `**/*.wiki.md` files. You can reference these articles using [[wikilink]] syntax, where "wikilink" is a wiki document's title or alias.

Load the `wiki` skill before writing new standalone documentation. Use the `wiki` CLI to search and read documentation.

```bash
wiki "Authorization" # Default `wiki [query]` returns ranked titles and summaries for matching articles
wiki "Example Article" # Exact titles still work as queries, but the output is ranked lookup results
```

<validation>
Lint and typecheck the entire project frequently — these operations are cheap. During development, focus test runs as tightly as possible: a single failing test or suite should be re-run alone until it passes. Broaden scope only for final confirmations or when a fix demands wider information.

Run validation from the package directory containing the changed files, using that package's scripts from `package.json` (e.g., `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`).

Run `yarn validate` from the workspace root for final validations — it typechecks, lints, tests, and builds all packages. The script merges stderr into stdout, prints `Exit code: N` at the end, and writes everything to `./yarn-validate-output.log`. **Run only `yarn validate` — do not add `2>&1`, `echo $?`, or any other wrapper.** Exit code 0 means all checks passed.

<git-mesh>

```bash
# Stage the mesh: slug titles the subsystem; line-range anchors (`path#L<start>-L<end>`) or whole-file anchors carry the path
git mesh add billing/checkout-request-flow \
  web/checkout.tsx#L88-L120 \
  api/charge.ts#L30-L76

# Name the subsystem, flow, or concern the anchors collectively form, and say plainly what it does across them
git mesh why billing/checkout-request-flow \
  -m "Checkout request flow that carries a charge attempt from the browser to the Stripe-backed server."

# The post-commit hook runs `git mesh commit`
git commit -m "Wire checkout to charge API"

# Later ...

# Run `git mesh stale [--patch] [glob]` and carefully examine the files in each mesh to identify drift
git mesh stale
```
